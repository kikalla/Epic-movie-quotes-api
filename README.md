### Getting Started
<br>

1\. First of all you need to clone Epic movie-quotes repository from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/giorgi-kikadze-epic-movie-quotes-api.git
```

2\. Next step requires you to run *composer install* in order to install all the dependencies.
```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```
in order to build your JS/SaaS resources.

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#
**MYSQL:**
>DB_CONNECTION=mysql
>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
>DB_PORT=3306
>DB_DATABASE=*****
>DB_USERNAME=*****
>DB_PASSWORD=*****

#

after setting up **.env** file, execute:
```sh
php artisan config:cache
```
in order to cache environment variables.

4\. Now execute in the root of you project following:
```sh
  php artisan key:generate
```
Which generates auth key.

##### Now, you should be good to go!

### Development
<br>
You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```sh
  php artisan serve
```

when working on JS you may run:

```sh
  npm run dev
```
it builds your js files into executable scripts.
If you want to watch files during development, execute instead:

```sh
  npm run watch
```
it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.
